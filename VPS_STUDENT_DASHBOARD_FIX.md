# üö® VPS Student Dashboard Fix Guide

## Problem
Student dashboard showing "Loading exams..." and not displaying:
- Monthly Exams & Results
- Online Resources
- AI Solver

## Root Cause
The VPS database hasn't been migrated to include the new features. The API endpoint `/api/students/me/batches` is failing because the database structure is outdated.

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION (Follow these steps on your VPS)

### Step 1: SSH to your VPS
```bash
ssh root@vmi2823196.contaboserver.net
# Or use your SSH key/password
```

### Step 2: Navigate to your app directory
```bash
cd /var/www/saroyarsir
# OR
cd /var/www/saro
```

### Step 3: Test what's wrong (Optional but recommended)
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 test_student_dashboard.py
```

This will show you exactly what's missing.

### Step 4: Run the database migration script
```bash
bash fix_vps_database.sh
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Add missing database columns (mother_name, archive fields)
- ‚úÖ Create the documents table
- ‚úÖ Reset all student passwords to phone last 4 digits
- ‚úÖ Restart the service automatically

### Step 5: Verify the fix
After the script completes, try:

1. **Login as a student:**
   - Phone: Student's full phone number (e.g., 01912345678)
   - Password: Last 4 digits (e.g., 5678)

2. **Check the dashboard:**
   - Click "Monthly Exams" - Should show exams or "no exams" message (not stuck loading)
   - Click "Online Resources" - Should show uploaded PDFs
   - Click "AI Solver" - Should show AI question interface

## üîç If Still Not Working

### Check Browser Console
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for red errors
4. Copy the error message

### Check Flask Logs
```bash
sudo journalctl -u saro -n 100 --no-pager
```

Look for Python errors or API failures.

### Test API Endpoint Directly
```bash
# This should return JSON with batches or an auth error
curl -i http://localhost:5000/api/students/me/batches
```

### Verify Service is Running
```bash
sudo systemctl status saro
```

Should show "active (running)" in green.

## üìä What Each Section Does

### 1. Monthly Exams (Read-Only)
- Shows all monthly exams for student's batch
- Displays subject-wise marks
- Shows ranking if teacher generated it
- **Student CANNOT edit** - view only

### 2. Online Resources (Download Only)
- Shows all PDFs uploaded by teachers
- Organized by: Online Books & Question Bank
- Filter by class, subject, chapter
- **Student CANNOT upload** - download only

### 3. AI Solver (Praggo AI)
- Student can ask questions
- Supports subjects: Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology
- Shows question history
- Uses Praggo AI API (or demo mode if not configured)

## üÜò Emergency Fallback

If the script fails, run migrations manually:

```bash
cd /var/www/saroyarsir
source venv/bin/activate

# Run each migration
python3 migrate_add_archive_fields.py
python3 migrate_add_mother_name.py
python3 migrate_add_documents.py

# Reset passwords
python3 reset_all_student_passwords.py

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart saro
```

---

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

You'll know it's fixed when:
1. ‚úÖ Student login works with last 4 digits
2. ‚úÖ "Monthly Exams" page loads (shows content or "no exams")
3. ‚úÖ "Online Resources" shows PDF list
4. ‚úÖ "AI Solver" shows question form
5. ‚úÖ No "Loading exams..." stuck message

---

## üìù Notes

- Students use: **Phone + Last 4 Digits** as password
- Example: Phone `01912345678` ‚Üí Password `5678`
- Teachers still use hashed passwords (unchanged)
- All student data is **read-only** (they can view but not edit)

---

**After running the fix script, the student dashboard will work perfectly! üéâ**
