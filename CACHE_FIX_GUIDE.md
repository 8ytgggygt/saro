## 🐛 Still Not Working?

### Check if Flask Server is Running
```bash
ps aux | grep "python.*app.py"
```

Should show the process running.

### Check Flask Logs
Look at the terminal where Flask is running. Check for errors.

### Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Test if student batches endpoint works
curl http://localhost:5000/api/students/me/batches

# Test if documents endpoint works
curl http://localhost:5000/api/documents/?include_inactive=true
```

### Check Database
```bash
.venv/bin/python test_student_dashboard.py
```

This will show if:
- Students exist in database
- Batches exist
- Student has batch enrollment

## 💡 Why This Happened

1. **Browser cached the old HTML** - Your browser saved the old dashboard_student.html
2. **Flask served from cache** - Browser didn't request new file from server
3. **VPS also cached** - Nginx or browser on VPS side also cached old version

**Solution:** Force cache clear + version timestamp in HTML

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it's fixed when:
1. ✅ Menu shows exactly 7 items
2. ✅ "Online Exams" completely gone
3. ✅ "Monthly Exams" loads properly (not stuck)
4. ✅ "Online Resources" shows PDFs
5. ✅ "AI Solver" shows question form
6. ✅ Everything is read-only for students
