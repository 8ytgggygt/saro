# Fee Management Save Fix

## ❌ Problem
- **Error:** HTTP 404 when trying to save fee amounts
- **Symptom:** Could not save monthly fee entries in Fee Management section
- **Screenshot Error:** "HTTP 404" displayed in red

## ✅ Solution
**Server Restart Required** - The fee routes were already implemented but the server needed to be restarted to load them.

## 🔧 Fix Applied
1. **Restarted Flask server** to load the `/api/fees/monthly-save` endpoint
2. **Verified endpoint** is now responding correctly
3. **Tested** with sample data - fees are being saved successfully

## 📝 Technical Details

### Endpoint Information:
- **URL:** `POST /api/fees/monthly-save`
- **Location:** `routes/fees.py` (line 873)
- **Function:** `save_monthly_fee_noauth()`
- **Status:** ✅ Working

### Required Fields:
```json
{
  "student_id": 2,
  "month": 1,
  "year": 2025,
  "amount": 500
}
```

### Response Example:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "fee": {
      "amount": 500.0,
      "fee_id": 2,
      "month": 1,
      "student_id": 2,
      "year": 2025
    }
  },
  "message": "Fee created successfully",
  "success": true
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Fee Save:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/fees/monthly-save \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "student_id": 2,
    "month": 1,
    "year": 2025,
    "amount": 500
  }'
```

### Expected Result:
- ✅ Status 200
- ✅ Fee created/updated successfully
- ✅ Fee appears in database and UI

## 📋 How to Use Fee Management

1. **Go to Fees section** in the sidebar
2. **Select a batch** from dropdown
3. **Select academic year**
4. **Enter amounts** in the table cells for each student/month
5. **Click outside the cell** or press Enter to save
6. **Amount is saved automatically** via AJAX

### Features:
- ✅ Auto-save on blur/change
- ✅ Update existing fees
- ✅ Create new fees
- ✅ Delete fees (enter 0)
- ✅ Visual feedback on save

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Students must be enrolled in a batch** to have fees
2. **Amounts are in Taka (BDT)**
3. **0 amount deletes the fee** entry
4. **Month must be 1-12**
5. **Year must be 2020-2030**

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

Currently using `/monthly-save` endpoint (no auth for testing).
Should migrate to `/monthly` endpoint with proper authentication.

## ✅ Status
- ✅ Fee save endpoint working
- ✅ Server restarted and healthy
- ✅ Ready for use
- ✅ No code changes needed

**Please refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R) and try saving fees again!**
