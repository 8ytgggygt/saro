# ðŸ”§ URGENT FIX: Utils Not Defined Error

## Problem Found âœ…
Browser console showed: `ReferenceError: utils is not defined`

## Root Cause
The code was calling `utils.showAlert()` but `utils` wasn't globally available yet when the function executed.

## Solution Applied
Changed `utils.showAlert()` to `window.utils.showToast()` with fallback to native `alert()` if utils isn't loaded.

## Deploy on VPS NOW

```bash
cd /var/www/saroyarsir
git pull origin main
sudo systemctl restart saro
```

## Test Again

1. **Open website** and login
2. **Press F12** to open Console
3. **Go to Monthly Exams** â†’ Results & Rankings
4. **Click "Generate Final Ranking"**
5. **Check console** - should now show:
   ```
   ðŸ”„ Generating ranking for exam ID: X
   ðŸ“¡ Response status: 200
   âœ… Rankings generated: {...}
   ```

## Expected Behavior

âœ… No more "utils is not defined" error  
âœ… Blue toast notification appears: "Generating rankings..."  
âœ… Console shows debug logs  
âœ… Success toast appears: "Final rankings generated and saved successfully!"  
âœ… Modal opens with comprehensive results
